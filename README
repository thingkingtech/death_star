Death Star art piece by Ralph Borland in Amazon offices

3 sections, trench, death star and target
Each section has led tubes that light up in order to create animation
Middle section (death star) has 4x2 = 8 scrolling LED screens displaying default ASCII text, with ability to customize through webiste. LED tube animations can also be controlled from website (always on, always off, or animated)

Default state = leds on, default ASCII scrolling text.

LED tubes are controlled by an Arduino. Raspberry Pi sets state of LED animations by setting GPIO pins 1/0 as an input to Arduino. Arduino checks input pins state and animates tubes accordingly.
